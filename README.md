Welcome to the **Todo UK**! This project aims to bridge cultures and share the beauty of guaranteed places in the UK with people from around the world. As someone with a background in both Korea and the UK, I wanted to create an easy-to-approach website that provides valuable information about unique locations, attractions, and experiences.
