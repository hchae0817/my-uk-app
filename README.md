# Todo UK

## Overview

Welcome to the **Todo UK**! This project aims to bridge cultures and share the beauty of guaranteed places in the UK with people from around the world. As someone with a background in both Korea and the UK, I wanted to create an easy-to-approach website that provides valuable information about unique locations, attractions, and experiences.

The primary goal of this project is to provide users with a user-friendly platform where they can:

- **Explore Categories:** Users can browse through various categories such as landmarks, restaurants, entertainment, and more, making it easy to find places of interest.

- **Enquire for Details:** Users can fill out a simple enquiry form to request more information about specific places, ensuring they get the information they need to plan their visits.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The website is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, making it accessible for users from diverse backgrounds.
- **Category and Tag Filtering:** Users can filter their search based on categories and tags, making it easier to discover new places.
- **Enquiry Form:** A straightforward form allows users to ask for more details about specific locations, enhancing their planning experience.
- **Responsive Design:** The site is built with responsiveness in mind, ensuring it looks great on all devices.

## How to Use
